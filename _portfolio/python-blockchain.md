short-description: An Introduction to Bitcoin and Blockchains with Python - PyDiff 2018

---
In this workshop, we go through all of the simple components that make up a blockchain, creating each of them using basic Python.
By the end we have a fully functional blockchain, all in a jupyter notebook for you to play around with.
The slides can be found [here](https://github.com/theref/BitcoinBlockchainPresentation/blob/master/main.pdf) and the recording of the workshop is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fAR9-9QzVs).
